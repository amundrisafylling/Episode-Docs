# Search vectors

Performs a vector search agains a PostgreSQL database and returns an [IVectorSearchResult](../../api-reference/built-in-types/ai/i-vector-search-result.md) object that can be passed to a Chat completion action.

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
This flow processes a user's chat question by first receiving it through a [Chat completion](../../triggers/ai/chat-completion-trigger.md) trigger, then converting it into a vector using a [text embedder](../azure-ai/text-embedder.md), performing a **Vector search** in a PostgreSQL database for relevant context, and finally passing the user input and retrieved context to an Azure AI [Chat completion](../azure-ai/chat-completion.md) action, which generates a response that is returned to the client via the [Return](../built-in/return.md) node.

| Title                    | Optional  | The title or name of the action. |
| Connection               | Required  | The PostgreSQL database connection that will be used for the search.          |
| Table                    | Required  | The name of the table where the vector search will be performed. |
| Search text              | Required  | The input text string used to perform the vector search, can be provided by a trigger (see below). |
| Record definition       | Required  | The definition of columns used in vector search. Note! The vector column is not part of the returned data. |
| Filter                   | Optional  | A filter expression to narrow down the records (e.g., category = blue). |
| Top                      | Optional  | The maximum number of top results to return. |
| Skip                     | Optional  | The number of top results to skip (default: *0*). |
| [Distance function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/distance-functions)  | Optional  | The method for calculating vector similarity, e.g., *Cosine Distance* (default). |
| Score limit    | Optional  | A threshold value that limits results to those with a distance score at or below this score (for e.g. CosineDistance). |
| Prompt template            | Optional  | The prompt template controls the output format for your search results. The system replaces placeholders, such as @[fieldName], with the corresponding data from your vector search fields. See example below. |
| Search result variable name | Optional | The name of the variable to store results. |
| Command timeout (seconds) | Optional       | The time limit for command execution before it times out. Default is 120 seconds.  |
| Description | Optional        | Additional notes or comments about the action or configuration.      |

#### Record definition

The record defintion specifies the data returned from the search.  
You are required to specify the **key**, **content** and **vector** fields in **Field definitions**. ![img](../../../../images/strz2.jpg)

#### Prompt template

The prompt template allows you to customize the format of the output from your vector search. This is useful for structuring the search results in a way that is most useful for your application.
You can use placeholders in the format @[fieldName] to include specific data from your search results. The system will replace these placeholders with the actual values from the corresponding fields in the search results.

## Returns 

The Search vectors action returns an [IVectorSearchResult](../../api-reference/built-in-types/ai/i-vector-search-result.md) object that can be passed to the Chat completion Context property.
