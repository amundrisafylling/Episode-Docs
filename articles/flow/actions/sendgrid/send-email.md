**Example** ![Example](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
**This flow retrieves files or content from a source system and sends an automated email using SendGrid.**  
For example, you could trigger a flow when a form is submitted, build a PDF, and email it to the recipient with custom messaging and attachments.
