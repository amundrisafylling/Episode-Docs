# Connecting to PowerOffice Go

To use PowerOffice Go actions in **Hypergene Flow**, you must either select an **existing connection** or create a new one.

<br/>

The connection authorizes Flow to interact with the PowerOffice Go API on your behalf. It requires authentication credentials issued for your registered client application.

<br/>
