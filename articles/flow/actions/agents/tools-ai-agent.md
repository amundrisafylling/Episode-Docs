# Tools AI Agent

Defines an AI Agent that can use tools to perform actions, for example fetching data or calling APIs.

**Example** ![img](../../../../images/strz.jpg)  
The example above shows an agent that reads all Word documents in a OneDrive folder, summarizes them, and emails the summaries along with the original documents as attachments. The following prompts are used:  

**Instructions**  
```txt
You are an agent that will use the tools provided to you to perform the tasks requested by the user.  
If you cannot perform the task, stop without any retries.
```

**User prompt**  
```txt
From OneDrive, get all Word (.docx) documents in the 'Work' folder.
For each document, get the file and create a summary.
Send an email from luke.skywalker@rebellion.com to darth.vader@empire.com that contains all the summaries.  
Use the subject: 'Summary'.
Include all the Word documents as attachments to the email.
```

## Properties
| Name            | Required | Description                         |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Tools usage     | Optional     | Specifies whether the agent should use tool calling directly, or write and execute code to use the tools. [Read more about this topic below.](#tools-include) |
| Instructions    | Required     | The instruction given at the start of a conversation that sets the behavior, tone, and goals for the agent. It acts like a guide or personality primer, telling the chat model how it should respond (e.g., formal vs. casual), what role it should play (e.g., teacher, assistant, coder) and optionally what stategy you want it to prefer for decision making.  |
| User prompt     | Required     | This is the actual task that the agent is given, for example "Summarize all Word documents in my OneDrive folder named 'Work', and send the summarization to my-email@corp.com."  |
| Session ID      | Optional     | A session ID is required if you want to enable memory, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.|
| [Output mode](#output-mode)     | Optional     | `Agent response` or `Tool result`. Specifies whether the output from the agent should be the (last) LLM response, or the raw output of the (last) tool call. [Read more about agent output mode below.](#output-mode) |
| [Result data type](#result-data-type) | Optional    | Specifies whether you want the output of the of the agent to automatically be converted to a stronly typed object, such as a "Customer" business object or list of business objects. By default, the agent outputs text, but this option enables conversion to data objects if the agent is properly configured for that purpose. [Read more below.](#result-data-type) |
| Chat model      | Required     | The chat model accepts a set of instructions, reasons about _how_ to solve the task and utilizes tools to achive the final outcome. |
| Tools           | Required     | One or more tools that the agent to use to perform the tasks identified by the chat model. Tools the agent can use includes: <br/> [Azure Blob Storage Agent Tool](../azure-blob-storage/agent-tool.md) <br/> [OneDrive Agent Tool](../onedrive/agent-tool.md) <br/> [Outlook Agent Tool](../microsoft-365-outlook/agent-tool.md) <br/> [Markdown Agent Tool](../markdown/agent-tool.md)<br/>[MCP client tool](../mcp/mcp-client-tool.md) <br/> [Flow AI tool](../ai/flow-ai-tool.md)  | 
| Memory          | Optional     | Agent memory used to store and retrieve a previous conversation with the agent. Allows for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh. Note that memory requires a Session ID. |

### Choosing a chat model
When choosing a chat model, it is important to choose a chat model that is capable of using tools. Not all chat models can use tools, and there's currently no official list of which chat models supports tool calling. You simply have to read the documentation for each LLM to determine whether tool / function calling is supported. A list of known LLMs with tool/function calling capabilities includes (but not limited to):  
- OpenAI models: gpt
- Mistral AI models
- Anthropic models: Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus
- Meta Llama models
- Google Gemini models

If you enable `Code mode` in the Tools usage property, note that not all AI models are capable of reliably using this mode. In general, only the advanced models like GPT 5.2 or higher, Claude Opus and Sonnt 4.5 or higher produce reliable results in this mode. Smaller models like the GPT 5 mini series, DeepSeek, Kimi2 Thinking etc, are not capable of using code mode. Note that this may change in the future, so you'll just have to try out different models to see what works.

### Output mode
Options: `Agent response` or `Tool result`.  

An agent can answer a question, perform a task that produces data, or perform a task without returning anything at all.  
When you create an agent that returns data to Flow for further use, there are two ways to retrieve that data: from the last tool call or from the last LLM message.  
Retrieving data from the last tool call gives you the raw output produced by the tool, such as a list of customers or email addresses.  
Retrieving data from the last LLM message (`Agent response` which is the default) returns whatever the LLM chooses to produce after considering its tool calls, inputs, reasoning, and instructions.  
If an agent is expected to return data in a specific, structured format—for example, a list of customer business objects—you should use the `Tool result` option, as it provides predictable output.  
If an agent needs to analyze or reason about tool outputs before returning a response, you must use the `Agent response` option.

<br/>

### Result data type
The `Result data type` specifies the data type returned by the action. This makes the agent’s output easier to consume in subsequent actions in the flow.  

The default is `Object`, which means no conversion is performed and the action returns whatever the agent produces (depending on the selected Output mode).  

The selected data type must be compatible with the response from the underlying API. For example, if the LLM or a tool call returns a JSON string and you want the action to output a strongly typed business object or value, the structure of that object must match the JSON format. Likewise, if the model or tool returns a date string and `Result data type` is set to an integer, the conversion will fail due to incompatible types.

### Memory
To enable ongoing conversations with the AI instead of starting fresh each time, you need to add memory to the agent. This allows it to recall previous exchanges when processing new requests. By remembering key details—like user preferences, goals, or past actions—the agent can personalize responses, avoid repetition, and maintain continuity. The result is more natural, efficient, and human-like interactions, where the AI can reason and adapt over time.  
Flow has multiple built-in memory provides, such as [Agent memory for SQL Server](../sql-server/agent-memory.md) 

> [!NOTE]
> To use memory, you need to specify a Session ID. The Session ID is usually provided by the client, because the user (client) decides when they want to start a new conversation.

**Best practice when using memory**
- Use separate memory storage for each agent. For example, when using [SQL Server for agent memory](../sql-server/agent-memory.md), store each agent’s memory in its own table.  
- Apply a memory or chat reducer, such as the [Chat history truncation reducer](../ai/chat-history-truncation-reducer.md), to limit the size of the conversation history sent with each request. Because LLMs are stateless and receive the entire conversation history every time, token usage and costs increase, accuracy tends to decrease, and responses take longer. A reducer automatically trims the conversation history to keep it at a manageable level.
