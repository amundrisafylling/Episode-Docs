**Example**![Example](/images/strz.jpg)  
This flow can be triggered from multiple sources (HTTP, another flow, or a scheduled event) and processes customer data depending on the trigger type. When triggered, it evaluates the source:

- [If](../actions/built-in/if-else.md) the trigger is an HTTP request, the flow inserts new customers into the database.

- If the trigger is from another flow, it validates the customer records.

- If the trigger is a scheduled event, it updates existing customer data.

- For all other cases, the flow throws an exception with a custom error message.
